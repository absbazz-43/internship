## Introduction of icddr,b

As a project intern at the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B), I was assigned to the study that is the subject of this article. The icddr,b and its goals are briefly described in this chapter. It gives a brief overview of the project's goals and the project to which I was assigned. The exact duties that I was given while working on this project as an intern are also mentioned.


## About icddr,b

The South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) Cholera Research Laboratory (icddr,b) was founded in Dhaka in the 1960s. In research on diarrheal diseases, the Cholera Research Laboratory (CRL) quickly gained a reputation on a global scale. The creation, testing, and adoption of oral rehydration solution (ORS), a treatment that is thought to have saved tens of millions of lives globally, was one of its early major accomplishments. The CRL was given a new lease on life in 1978 when it was given the moniker International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh. Its sole name in recent years has been icddr,b.In order to address the main public health problems that Bangladesh and other countries in the global South face, icddr,b continued to extend its research. Numerous research initiatives have been carried out in fields like maternal, neonatal, respiratory, and vaccine testing.

## Major Achievements

Hereâ€™s a brief list of some major achievements of icddr,b:
  
 * Oral Rehydration Solution
 * Zinc Treatment for Diarrhea
 * Tetanus Toxoid Vaccine for Mothers
 * Guidelines for Treating Severe Malnutrition
 * Testing Vaccines
 * Family Planning Solutions
 * Domestic Violence Legislation
 * Mat for Measuring Maternal Blood Loss
 * Ultra Low-cost CPAP(Continuous positive airway pressure therapy) Device for se- vere pneumonia
 * Supplementary and therapeutic foodstuffs to prevent and treat malnutrition


## Internship Goal
Internships are generally thought of as a way to gain experience in a particular field. However, a wide array of people can benefit from Training Internships in order to receive real world experience and develop their skills. The following are the objectives of my internship:

* Apply statistical knowledge and concepts to real world decision making.
* Increase proficiency in specific statistical disciplines.
* Develop and improve skills in communication,quantitative reasoning,and teamwork.
* Meet professional role models and potential mentors who can provide guidance, feedback, and support.
* Expand network of professional relationships and contacts.
* Learn in details about the healthcare facilities of Bangladesh and how they work.
* Develop a solid work ethic and professional demeanor, as well as a commitment to ethical conduct and social responsibility.

##  My Assignmentment

During the internship period I was a member of a team at MCHD department. Our task was to find out if there is any trend in the improved sanitation condition of Bangladesh using available BDHS data of 2007 to 2017/18 and also point out the factors behind the trend if any. Following responsibilities were assigned to me as an intern :

* Literature review for analysis 
* Make an analysis plan
* Analyze the descriptive statistics
* Creating dummyt tables 
* Interpret the findings
* Help to write the final report

## Introduction of the study

Pneumonia and serious infections are leading cause of under-five death in Bangladesh. More than 30,000 under-five death are occured due to these reason. WHO recommended to follow Integrated management of childhood illness(IMCI) to manage these serious diseases in outpatient departments. For IMCI, there is a dedicated service register, monthly reporting form and DHIS2 report to track the progress. IMIC guidelines suggests that  child pneumonia and serious infection referred to higher level facilities for indoor management. But there is no dedicated register, monthly reporting form and DHIS2 report in Bangladesh. As a result, taking proper policy becomes difficult. So introducing a standardized register can keep a positive impact here and can be helped to improve skil of healthcare providers.It is important to track management to achieve the SDG target of reducing under-five deaths and neonatal deaths.a national technical committee was formed to develop a standardized register system.The National Newborn Health and IMCI programme helps to demonstrate the inpatient register in selected districts to inform evidence-based scale up.

## Literature review

\citet{wong2009developing}did a study on medical records accessibility and completeness and physician satisfaction in Ethiopia.
\citet{schmidt2014danish} shows that (Civil Registration System) CRS allows for technically easy, cost-effective, and unambiguous individual-level record linkage of Danish registers. 
\citet{pavlovic2021electronic} studies aimed to detect the factors that influence the acceptance of electronic health record(EHR).
\citet{wilkins2009factors} detected all factors that influenced acceptance of electronic health record(EHR).
\citet{lakbala2014physicians} explored physicians, attitude and perceptions for different functions of electronic medical records(EMR).
\citet{ludwick2009adopting} explored the acceptance of electronic medical records(EMR) in primary care in seven countries.

## Objectives of the study

The objective of the study is to assess the usability, acceptability , adoption , fidelity, utility and inpatinet register for managing sick newborns and children in selection facilities of Bangladesh.

# Methodology

## Study design 

A research study was conducted where the national newborn health and IMIC programmed designed, developed and demonstrated a standardized inpatinet for newborn and sick-children.Icddr,b provided implementation facilitation support and assessments.

## Study setting

The study was conducted in Kushtia and Dinajpur district of Bangladesh. The standardized register was introduced in the pediatric department of district hospitals and all government sub-district hospitals of kushtia and Dinajpur district. 

## Introduction of the register

### Development 

The national newborn health and IMIC programme designed and developed the register system. To do this, a technical committee was formed under leadership of the national newborn health and IMIC programme.The team at first visited one district hospital and one sub district hospital to explore the existing methods/documents practices in the health facilities system and they mainly focus on the pediatric inpatient department. After that, they extract data from the pediatric department to understand the different types of caseloads and their management. 
They also reviewed different national and global guidelines, strategies, case recordings forms and others available there.

Four workshop were organizd by the technical committee to develop the register and they take some decisions from these discussions such as ,

 * Population : under five
 * Cover all diseases but with special focus on pneumonia and serious infection
 * Follow WHO pocket book for hospital care of children
 * The register should allow tracking of use of antibiotics in inpatient department.
 * Use ICD-10 code for diagnosis
 * Develop monthly reporting form based on the register
 * Register to be filled by nurses from case-record forms

```

### Implementation

The study is implemented in 

 * District and facility sensitization workshop
 * ToT for doctors 
 * Training of nurses
 * Supply register and reporting forms
 * Monitoring and evaluation 


## Study  participants

In that study, data are collected from sick newborn and under-five children admitted in the pediatric inpatient department. Service providers(doctors and nurses) and their supervisors,
Facility managers, district and sub-district health managers, national level health workers and policy makers.

## Sampling and sample size 

Here, a non-probabilistic sampling method named time quota sampling is used. This sampling is useful when time is limited, a sampling frame is not available, and the research budget is very tight. For this study, data is collected until the desired sample size is reached. For this study, a 4% margin of error and a 99% confidence level are considered. The population is considered infinite. All the domain's categories (type, age group, district, and sex) make 32 combinations. So per group, the estimated sample size is 372; for the overall 32 combinations, the total sample size is 11904.

## Data collection 

Data is collected from 1st, November 2022 to 31th, January 2023 (3 months duration).
At first, icddr,b nurses records some basic information from hospital coming under five patients and that is called tracker register. After that, hospital's nurses collected data from inpatient.That is called registered.Then again icddr,b nurses collected data from registered patients.That is called case registered.Total 11737 data are collected and case-recording data are 5062.

# Analysis

In that paper mainly focused on descriptive data analysis. Descriptive analysis is calculated for different questions vs different groups. These analysis gives us a overview of the new system and it's effectiveness and also helps us to detect the lagging of hospitals and this sytem and it's advantages also.

## Overall table 
In that table, a descriptive statistics of all variables is shown. This table gives me a overall idea of the dataset.The table gives an overview of basic informations of all 11737 patients.

## Adoption table

Every day, may there be many people in district and upazila hospitals. but nurses may not register all of them for various reasons. As a result, all patient information is not recorded in the register book. The adoption table indicates how many patients information is registered in the register book among those who come to the hospitals.

# Results of Analysis


The overall table shows that in the register, about 50% of the data are from the 1â€“5-year-old age group. About 60% of the data is collected from male groups; about 68% of the data is from Kushtia district; and almost 50â€“50% of the data is collected from both the district hospital (DH) and the Upazila health complex (UHC). Collected data is increasing month by month. The first month has the lowest collected data, and January has the highest collected data. Diarrhoea and Pneumonia patient's data are collected from respectively 16.08% and 10.66%. 44.92% of patients are discharged with advice only. The completeness table shows that among 11737 participants, 11650 registration numbers are filled up, which is about 99.26%. The table shows that in District hospitals, the completeness of registration numbers is quite lower than at UHC. Dinajpur district has a very high completeness of registration numbers, but there is a decreasing trend in the completeness of registration numbers by month. 99.30% of the data are collected without supervision. The completeness table shows that among 11737 participants, 11592 participants with dates of admission are filled up, which is about 98.76%. The table shows that in District hospitals, the completeness of the date of admission is quite lower than at UHC. Dinajpur district has a high completeness of registration numbers, and in every month of admission completion, the rate is 100%. 99.11% of the data are collected without supervision. The completeness table shows that among 11737 participants, 10320 at the time of admission were filled up, which is about 87.93%. The table shows that in District hospitals, the completion time of admission is quite higher than at UHC. Dinajpur district has a very low completeness of time of admission, but there is a decreasing trend in the completeness of time of admission by month. 86.76% of the data were collected without supervision. The completeness table shows that among 11737 participants, 11697 names are filled up, which is about 99.66%. The table shows that in District hospitals, the completeness of names is quite higher than at UHC. Dinajpur district has a low completeness of name, but there is an increasing trend in the completeness of name by month. 99.53% of the data were collected without supervision.

## Conclusion

From the tables,it is seen that in some cases, district hospitals complete more items than upazila health complexes (UHC), and sometimes UHC does better than district hospitals. But in terms of quality of care, district hospitals outperform UHC. Adoption table shows that service providers try to record the information of all patients comming to the hospitals. In terms of accuracy, UHC performs much better. This is because the population coming to the district hospital is higher than at UHC. Because of this traffic, these problems occur. So these problems can be solved by increasing manpower (nurses), increasing the training of nurses, and solving other problems that arise in hospitals.If this registration system's accuracy increases day by day and if it performs well in others district and UHC, then it can be computerized, efficiency can be improved, and a very strong database system can be introduced to our health system that will help our medical system.

## Future works

After these descriptive works, our main goal is to turn it into a model and find out the acceptance ratio of this register system.In this case, our interested question is "Whether service providers acceptance these question or not". This data is already collected from service providers by icddr,b. Now have to implement them and go into the depths of the dataset and try to make a strong policy later to develop our health facility system.
