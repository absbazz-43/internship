In collaboration with academic and research institutions over the world, icddr,b conducts research, training and extension activities, as well as programme-based activities, to develop and share knowledge for global lifesaving solutions. I feel lucky to be able to complete my internship programme with such a reputed organization. I am grateful to ISRT and icddr,b. There is a department named Maternal and Child Health department(MCHD) do research on maternal and neonatal health. I have completed my internship at this department and was assigned to a project named Introducing a Standardized Register for Strengthening the Inpatient Management of Newborn and Sick Children: Implementation research in selected health facilities in Bangladesh". In this project my task was to literature review, analyze descriptive statistics, interpret the findings and help to write the project paper. During my internship period, I tried my best to work sincerely and punctually at that organization and tried to be honest, sincere and devoted to my assigned duties.
